## How it works
1.	Access to the academy is set in either $Near or $Aurora.
2.	Users need to lock the required amount of tokens for 12 months on our platform.
3.	Our contract takes those tokens and stakes them in the Metapool protocol to obtain $stNear or $stAurora, depending on the token the user deposited.
4.	The liquid staking tokens are locked in our vault, and the rewards will be received by Stakedemy.
5.	70% of the rewards will be allocated to the gamification and incentive ecosystem for learning and development within the community.
6.	30% will go to Stakedemy.
7.	At the end of the 12-month period, users can retrieve the tokens they had locked in our vault, minus a 3% commission, in addition to all the rewards earned within Stakedemy.
