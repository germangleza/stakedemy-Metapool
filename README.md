### Description
We are aware that education is key and necessary to build a better decentralized world, and what better way to provide this education than for free. However, free content is sometimes not valued or fully utilized.

That's why we developed Stakedemy: Stake to Learn and Earn academy, a gamified educational platform powered by liquid staking protocol tokens. Users must lock Near or Aurora tokens for a duration of 12 months to gain access. Our contract goes and stakes the tokens in MetaPool, taking the stNear or stAurora tokens and locking them for 12 months to grant access to the academy to the user. The rewards generated are used to gamify the educational platform and as a source of income for Stakedemy. 

Here's how it works:
1.	Access to the academy is set in either $Near or $Aurora.
2.	Users need to lock the required amount of tokens for 12 months on our platform.
3.	Our contract takes those tokens and stakes them in the Metapool protocol to obtain $stNear or $stAurora, depending on the token the user deposited.
4.	The liquid staking tokens are locked in our vault, and the rewards will be received by Stakedemy.
5.	70% of the rewards will be allocated to the gamification and incentive ecosystem for learning and development within the community.
6.	30% will go to Stakedemy.
7.	At the end of the 12-month period, users can retrieve the tokens they had locked in our vault, minus a 3% commission, in addition to all the rewards earned within Stakedemy.

At the end of the 12 months, users retrieve the tokens they had locked in our vault. With this model, you can continue to learn without spending capital, but by locking your tokens, you increase your commitment level to learning and could earn money based on your efforts.

We also developed a decentralized frontend component using BOS. The implementation allows the user to select which token to lock, either Near or Aurora, connect their wallet, and lock the tokens to gain access to the academy.
