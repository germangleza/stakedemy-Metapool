### Description
We are aware that education is key and necessary to build a better decentralized world, and what better way to provide this education than for free. However, free content is sometimes not valued or fully utilized.

That's why we developed Stakedemy: Stake to Learn and Earn academy, a gamified educational platform powered by liquid staking protocol tokens.

Users must lock $stNear or $stAurora tokens for 12 months to gain access. The rewards generated are used to gamify the educational platform and as a source of income for Stakedemy. At the end of the 12 months, users retrieve the tokens they had locked in our vault.

With this model, you can continue to learn without spending capital, but by locking your tokens, you increase your commitment level to learning and could earn money based on your efforts.
